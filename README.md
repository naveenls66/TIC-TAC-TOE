How to Play
Download or clone the project from the GitHub repository. Run the project in your IDE. Two players can play this game. The first player has to enter either X or O for any one box. The second player then enters the other X or O (opposite to what the first player has entered). The game continues unless any one of them gets a line cut either diagonally or straight. The person who founds the line is the winner of the game.
